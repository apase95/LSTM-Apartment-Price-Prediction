# 📈 HCMC Real Estate Price Prediction (Bi-LSTM)

Welcome to my project! This repository contains a Deep Learning model designed to predict real estate prices in **Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC)** based on historical data.

The core of this project is a **Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM)** model implemented in PyTorch.

--- --- 
## 🚀 Key Feature: Bi-LSTM
I have upgraded the standard LSTM model to a **Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory)** architecture.

### Why Bi-LSTM?
- **Standard LSTM:** Only learns from the past to the future (Forward).
- **Bi-LSTM:** Learns in two directions at the same time:
  - Forward (Past $\to$ Future)
  - Backward (Future $\to$ Past)

This allows the model to understand the context of the price trends much better than a basic LSTM.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### 1. Source Code 💻
- **main.py:** The main file. It runs the training loop, evaluates the model, and plots the results.
- **lstm_model.py:** Contains the BiLSTMModel class (The neural network architecture).
- **data_loader.py:** Handles data preprocessing, normalization (MinMaxScaling), and creating time-series sequences.
- **generate_data.py:** Helper script to process or generate dataset samples.

### 2. Datasets 📊
- **Dataset_BDS_HCM_Merged.csv:** The main dataset containing real estate prices in Ho Chi Minh City.
- **Dataset_BDS_HCM_Diff.csv:** Processed data (difference transformation) to make the time series stationary.
- **Dataset_GCC_HCM_2015_2025.csv:** Additional economic/construction data for the period 2015-2025.

## 🛠️ Model Architecture
The model in **lstm_model.py** is built using PyTorch:
```python
def step2_build_model(self):
        self.model = Sequential()
        self.model.add(Bidirectional(LSTM(128, return_sequences=True), #Direction
                                     input_shape=(self.look_back, self.n_features)))
        self.model.add(Dropout(0.2))
        self.model.add(Bidirectional(LSTM(64, return_sequences=False))) #Parameter
        self.model.add(Dropout(0.2))
        self.model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
        self.model.add(Dense(1))  # Output layer
        self.model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
```

## ⚙️ How to Run
### 1. Install dependencies: You need Python and the following libraries:
- torch (PyTorch)
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
### 2. Run the training:
```bash
python main.py
```
### 3. Result: The script will train the model and display a chart comparing Predicted Prices vs. Actual Prices.
